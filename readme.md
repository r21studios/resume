# Welcome
I **Haaaaate** writing resumes, but I like writing code... so
I thought that I could write a resume in code!  I've taken some liberty
in the code construction to make it more readable, but it's a workable
program.

If you're fortunate enough to have Python 3.3+ installed on your computer,
just plop the `resume.py` file onto your hard drive and run it using
`python resume.py` from your terminal window.

If you don't have Python 3.3+ on your system, you can just look
at the file. This way, you'll even get some ree jokes!

### NON-NERD TIP
Almost all of the code in `resume.py` should be pretty straightforward,
even if you're not programmer. If you stumble across something that 
doesn't make sense, it is probably just required syntax elements or 
a developer joke.
