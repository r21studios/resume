# Welcome
I *Haaaaate* writing resumes, but I like writing code... so
I thought that I could write a resume in code!  I've taken some liberties
in the code construction to make it more readable, but it's a workable
program.

If you're fortunate enough to have Python 3.3+ installed on your computer,
just plop this file onto your hard drive and run it using
`python resume.py` from your terminal window.

### NON-NERD TIP
Almost all of this should be pretty straightforward.
If you stumble across something that doesn't make sense, it is
probably just required syntax elements or a developer joke.
